{"name":"Elf On The Shelf - 2014","tagline":"Another Great Year","body":"To My Favorite Kids in Dundas,\r\n\r\n2014 has been another fun and exciting year. I am happy to say that I have been reporting only the best of behavior to Santa. Yes, there have been a few days that weren't so great, but overall the three of you have earned all of the presents I noticed your mom and dad placed under the tree. \r\n\r\nHave a very merry Christmas.\r\n\r\nI will see you again in 2015.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe Elf on _**your**_ Shelf.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
